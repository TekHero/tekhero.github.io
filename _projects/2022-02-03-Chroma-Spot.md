Chroma Spot is a simple yet rather fun game with the whole intention of figuring out which of colors on screen is the different one from the rest within a specified time. 

It is quite the challenge!

I built the app using entirely SwiftUI. I wanted to use this opportunity of building out an app idea using only SwiftUI not only for the quick prototyping usage perspective but also as a reinforcement in the knowledge of SwiftUI.

The app never made it to a public release, it was always one of those forever development projects that never made it to full completion but in time it will be released...at least that's the plan.
