Tappy Lights was a game idea that I got from the arcade actually. In the arcade, there was this game where there was a wall of buttons that lit up. The goal was to tap the lit up buttons as fast as you can within a predefined amount of time to score the highest possible score. So I recreated a 2D game version of that, it worked exactly how it's real life counterpart did which I think was a huge success.

The best part about this game I think was how I designed the buttons. I created two different states of the buttons which was lit up or pressed down by desiging it in a such a way that made the button appear 3D but it wasn't.
