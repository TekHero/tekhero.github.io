Spenditure is at its simplest, an expense tracking app. I built it so long ago but at the moment of its development, it was a great learning experience in itself. The reason being is that Spenditure utilized a variety of core principles of iOS Development that most apps used and it was a way for me to learn how to use certain techniques. 

The design process for the app was meant to be as simple and straightforward as possible with the least amount of overly stacked data on screen.
