Shift The Line was my attempt at recreating an incredibly popular game at the time of it's release called Pop The Lock, which if you don't remember or know of, how the game operated was that a Line would spin around a circle and you'd have to stop the line on a particular spot in that circle to score a point. My version of the game was a tad bit different in that instead of a singular point you'd have stop the line on, instead a color would appear in the form of a text and you'd have to stop the line on that spot that contained the matching color. 

The game was built entirely in SpriteKit.
