Rebound It was one of my more simpler yet most addicting game that I've built. The idea behind this game was a twist of the classic game Pong, but the twist that I added for my version is that instead of bouncing the ball back to the other paddle, it was instead a single paddle bouncing more than one ball all around an invisible barrier that I placed along the top, leading and trailing borders of the screen. Essentially it would be closely aligned with the real life version of Indoor Pickleball but a 2D version if you will.

All the assets in the game were also designed by myself.

Unlike RGBShooter, I was able to recompile this game after rewriting some portions of the app, however due to the nature of screen size and syntax changes, the app doesn't quite look or operate at the same level that it once was. Which means, I would need to do some additional rewriting of the app to get it back to its original state.

The game was built in SpriteKit.
