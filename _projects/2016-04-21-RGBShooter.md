RGB Shooter is one of my most complex 2D style games that I've built. The idea behind was essentially a recreation of an classic game called Galaga. I wanted to see if it would be possible for me to build a game similar to the mechanics of that classic game, which included some physics, collisions, lots of user interaction components and plenty of conditional gameplay logic.

All the assets in the game were hand designed by myself using Photoshop and Illustrator.

I built and release this particular game back in 2016 I think, or at least that's when the files were last modified. I've tried to see if it would be plausible to recompile the app using the latest version of XCode and Swift but to no success, since it is so old in comparison. I would have to rewrite portions of the app just to get it to build.

Maybe when there's time, I'll look into rewriting the game into the newest version of Swift. 

This game was built in SpriteKit.
