Hey what's up! My name is Brian, and I'm an iOS Software Engineer based out of New York. I've been building apps since 2014 and building professionally since 2018. Outside of professional work, you can find me brainstorming new ideas and constantly learning new things. However, if I'm not doing that. I'm most definitely binge-watching a TV show of some sort.

My primary skills are in iOS Development but that's not to say I'm limited to that only. I have experience building backend's following the LAMP stack model, as well as a bit of writing scripts using Python.
